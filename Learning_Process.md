# Learning Process

## Question 1: What is the Feynman Technique?

The Feynman Technique is a four-step learning method that involves explaining a concept in simple language as if you were teaching it to someone else, like a child, in order to identify and address gaps in your understanding.

## Question 2: In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

One of the most interesting ideas is the *Pinball Metaphor* for the brain, which explains how our thoughts move through different neural pathways based on our level of focus.

Another highlight was the story of Salvador Dalí and Thomas Edison, who used a creative technique involving keys or ball bearings to wake themselves as they drifted into sleep, helping them capture innovative ideas from their relaxed, diffused state of mind.

## Question 3: What are active and diffused modes of thinking?

### Focused (Active) Mode
This mode is used when we concentrate on a specific task that we are already somewhat familiar with. In this mode, thoughts travel along tightly packed and well-established neural pathways.

### Diffuse Mode
This is a relaxed and resting state of the brain where thoughts can wander freely across different neural connections. It is especially helpful for understanding new concepts and finding creative solutions to problems.

## Question 4: According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic?

- **Deconstruct the skill** – Break the skill down into the smallest possible sub-skills.
- **Learn enough to self-correct** – Use 3–5 resources to learn just enough to recognize mistakes.
- **Remove barriers to practice** – Eliminate distractions such as the internet or television.
- **Practice for at least 20 hours** – Commit to focused practice to overcome the initial frustration barrier.

## Question 5: What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?

- **Embrace the Feynman Technique:** Whenever I learn a new software concept, I will explain it in my own words or teach it to a peer to ensure deep understanding.
- **Use Pomodoro for Deep Work:** I will work in 25-minute focused sessions without distractions, followed by short breaks to maintain attention.
- **Balance Thinking Modes:** Whenever I get stuck on a coding problem, I will step away briefly to allow diffused thinking to help generate solutions.
