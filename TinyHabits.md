## 1. Tiny Habits – BJ Fogg

### Question 1: Most Interesting Idea

The most interesting idea for me was that habits don’t fail because of lack of motivation, but because they are designed poorly. BJ Fogg explains that starting extremely small — like doing just two push-ups — makes habits easy to begin and sustainable over time.

## 2. Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg – Core Message

### Question 2: How can you use B = MAP to make new habits easier? What are M, A, and P?

BJ Fogg’s behavior formula is:

**B = MAP**  
Behavior happens when **Motivation, Ability, and Prompt** come together.

- **M = Motivation** → The desire to do the behavior  
- **A = Ability** → How easy the behavior is to do  
- **P = Prompt** → The trigger that reminds you to do it  

To make habits easier, focus on increasing **Ability** (make it tiny and simple) rather than depending on motivation. Attach the new tiny habit to an existing routine (prompt).

### Question 3: Why is it important to "Shine" or Celebrate?

Celebrating immediately after completing a habit creates a positive emotion in the brain. Emotions wire habits. When you celebrate, your brain connects happiness with that action, making it more likely to repeat. Whatever you celebrate becomes automatic over time.

## 3. 1% Better Every Day Video

### Question 4: Most Interesting Idea

The most interesting idea was that small improvements done consistently every day lead to massive long-term results. Improving just 1% daily may seem small, but over time it compounds into significant growth.

## 4. Book Summary – Atomic Habits

### Question 5: Book’s Perspective About Identity

The book emphasizes that real change happens when you focus on identity, not just outcomes. Instead of saying "I want to run a marathon," say "I am becoming a runner." Habits shape identity, and identity reinforces habits.

### Question 6: How to Make a Habit Easier to Do?

According to the book, to make a habit easier:

- Make it obvious  
- Make it attractive  
- Make it easy  
- Make it satisfying  

Reduce friction. Break the habit into very small steps. Prepare your environment in advance so the action requires minimal effort.

### Question 7: How to Make a Habit Harder to Do?

To break a bad habit:

- Make it invisible  
- Make it unattractive  
- Make it difficult  
- Make it unsatisfying  

Increase friction. Remove triggers from your environment and make the bad habit inconvenient.
